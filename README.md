# Whiteboard is a simple buildtool for C
Whiteboard is a simple buildtool for C.
Whiteboard is meant to be plug and play and really simple and easy to use. If you look in the Examples sections can you see how you can easily set this up.

# Features
* Easy plug and play design
* TOML is easy to learn and use
* Test support
* Change CC and LD easily along with their args
* Different source file extensions (for compatibliity with C++)

# How it works
Whiteboard will create a `target` dir with your package name as another dir inside so file structure will look like this:
```
target/
  Example/
```
Whiteboard will then create a `bin` and `obj` dir inside of the project name dir so it will look like this:
```
target/
  Example/
    bin/
    obj/
```
Whiteboard builds your `src` dir and lumps everything into the `obj` dir (subject to change) and then builds with those objs into the `bin` folder with the name of the bin and version in the format of `<binname>-<version>`.

# Compiling
You can run these commands with gcc to compile (on linux) or figure it out on your own.
```
mkdir -p target/Whiteboard && mkdir -p target/Whiteboard/obj target/Whiteboard/bin
gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -c $(find src -type f -name "*.c") -I src
mv *.o target/Whiteboard/obj
gcc -B gcc target/Whiteboard/obj/* -o target/Whiteboard/bin/NewRelease-0.0.1.0
```
Windows compilation (might be out of date so you might need to add some new C files to the command)
```
mkdir target && mkdir target\Whiteboard && mkdir target\Whiteboard\obj && mkdir target\Whiteboard\bin
gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -c src\args_parser.c src\main.c src\run_bin.c src\stages.c src\string_replace.c src\toml.c src\toml_format.c src\vector.c -I src
mv *.o target\Whiteboard\obj
gcc -B gcc target\Whiteboard\obj\* -o target\Whiteboard\bin\NewRelease-0.0.1.0
```

# CLI Usage
`whiteboard run <name?>` If no name is supplied builds and runs the default bin otherwise it will build and run the bin with that name.

`whiteboard build <name?>` If no name is supplied it builds the default bin otherwise it will build the bin with that name.

`whiteboard test <name>` Builds and runs the test with that name.

`whiteboard clean` Removes the target dir.


# Examples
This is an example config you can use (and it will use gcc by default)
```toml
[package]
name = "Example"
version = "0.1.0.0"

[[bin]]
default = true
name = "Example"
```
Now you can run `whiteboard run` to run the project, where whiteboard is the exe of whiteboard.

Another example is
```toml
[package]
name = "Example2"
version = "0.1.0.0"

[[bin]]
default = true
name = "Example2"
cc = "clang"
ld = "clang"
ccargs = "-O3 -Wall -Wextra"
```
You can see this uses a different compiler and linker from the default `gcc` and adds some extra args.

Here is a completely filled out toml
```toml
[package]
name = "Example3"
version = "0.1.0.0"

[[bin]]
default = true
name = "Example3"
srcdir = ["src/"] # can either be an array or a string
includedir = "src/include" # only a string
cc = "clang"
ld = "clang"
ccargs = "-O3"
ldargs = "-B clang"
extension = "c" # Extension of the source files

[[test]]
name = "Test"
srcdir = ["test/Test"] # can either be an array or a string
includedir = "test/Test/include" # only a string
programincludedir = "src/include" # where to get the include dir from the actual code
cc = "clang"
ld = "clang"
ccargs = "-O3"
ldargs = "-B clang"
extension = "c" # Extension of the source files
```
